  This is a fork of https://github.com/bbkiwi/Adafruit-Raspberry-Pi-Python-Code.
  Because github.com doesn't support a fork of a fork, i created my own repo,
  and merged it with bbkiwi's, which is a fork of Adafruit's Python Code Library.
  
  I am adding some usefull functions for the LCDChar_Plate, not improving the
  existing library (that's all bbkiwi's and adafruit's work).
  Summary and description of my functions are(will be soon) in wiki.
  
  You can freely copy, use and change my sourcecode.
  I am very curious about improvements and ideas, pls. inform me about every good advice.
